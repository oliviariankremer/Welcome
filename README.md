# Hi, I'm Olivia Kremer 👋  
**Aspiring Data Analyst | SQL • Excel • Power BI • R**

I’m a data-driven problem solver with a strong interest in transforming raw information into meaningful, actionable insights. I enjoy exploring patterns, building visualizations, and supporting data-informed decision making across a variety of industries — including retail, sports, social media, healthcare, and finance.

In my current role as a Healthcare Reimbursement Associate at a top 20 CPA firm, I prepare detailed Medicare and Medicaid cost reports for hospitals and nursing homes. Working with complex financial, operational, and regulatory data has fueled my interest in data analytics and sharpened my ability to turn raw data into meaningful insights.
